This project has a number of uses. Essentially it is a light alarm which is triggered into oscillation by the Light-Dependent-Resistor. Under dark conditions the LDR has very high resistance and thus the first transistor has no bias on its base. This prevents the multivibrator from functioning and in this condition draws only about lma. As the light intensity increases, the resistance of the photocell decreases and the multi-vibrator starts up. Its frequency gradually rises to a high pitched whistle as set by the limiting resistor in series with it. Now, the possibilities for an alarm of this nature are endless. It will give an audible indication of the intensity of a light source or compare two illuminations. As an alarm it is useful as a theft device. It can be put into a cupboard or drawer to protect it from prying fingers. It can be used as an alert for the medicine chest or money drawer. In any case its advantage lies in the fact that it doesn't have to be wired to any switches and can be moved around with ease.  A piece of veroboard 12 holes long will accommodate all the parts making it a very compact project which can be disguised as a packet of pills by using a suitable empty container.
